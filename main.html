    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient, especially for handling large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute relative to the size of the input data. It is commonly represented using Big O notation, such as <code>O(n)</code>, where n is the size of the input.
