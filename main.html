    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to represent the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are crucial for solving problems within a reasonable time frame, especially for large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as <code>O(n)</code>, where n is the size of the input data. This helps in understanding how memory requirements grow as the input size increases.
